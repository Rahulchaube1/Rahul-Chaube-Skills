# Self Correction

## Overview

Reading compilation errors and repairing AST surgically. This deep-dive module provides advanced prompt engineering and systemic context rules.

## When to Use

- When building production-ready cognitive loops requiring high logical alignment.
- When standard models drift or ignore simple constraints.

## When NOT to Use

- For simple one-off tasks where speed and low latency are prioritized.

## Best Practices

- **Define Explicit Goals**: Structure success boundaries before generating inputs.
- **Negative Enclosures**: Wrap forbidden patterns inside `<not_allowed>` tags.
- **AST Checks**: Validate code formatting prior to test execution.

## Common Mistakes

- **Premature Execution**: Letting the model edit files without creating an implementation plan.
- **Over-Abstraction**: Creating abstract interfaces where single functions would suffice.

## Advanced Techniques

- **Dynamic Context Injection**: Injecting variables dynamically based on prompt length constraints.
- **Self-Healing AST**: Interfacing compiler stack traces directly to model correction prompts.

## Prompt Template

```markdown
<instructions>
You are executing the SELF-CORRECTION skill. 
Analyze the task below, write an implementation plan, and verify all constraints.
</instructions>
<task>
{{task_description}}
</task>
```

## Production Use Case

- Automated local refactoring pipelines correcting linter errors autonomously in CI/CD cycles.

## Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Model states assumptions explicitly.
- [ ] No speculative helper functions are written.
- [ ] Output formatting passes lint validation check.
